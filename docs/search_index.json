In this project, we propose the following questions aiming to provide some insights for preparation and assessment of natural disasters: 1. What are the patterns of occurrence for the most frequently happening disasters by region? 2. Over time, how do the patterns change and how do they help people prepare for future disasters? 3. Study the damage of a disaster and how does the damage a disaster of different types brought to a region differ over time? "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources The data set we chose is from EM-DAT (The International Disaster Database) at https://public.emdat.be/data. EM-DAT (Emergency Event Database) was created with the initial support of the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Belgian Government. It contains essential core data on the occurrence and effects of over 22,000 mass disasters in the world from 1900 to the present day. The database is compiled from various sources, including UN agencies, non-governmental organisations, insurance companies, research institutes and press agencies.To narrow down the range of the data for the use of this project, we selected natural disaster data from all five continents, dating between 1990 to 2020. Query the natural disaster data from source and select natural disaster in all locations provided between time range 1990 to 2020 which generates a single excel file. When reading the excel file, we skip the first 6 title lines and assign the column names accordingly. The raw data has 50 attributes and 11618 rows in total. ## [1] 11618 50 Possible issues with the data: We know that the database is compiled from various sources from organizations and agencies, so there might be concerns about the consistency of information. Also, since the we are looking at data over a 30-year range, so there might also be concerns about the ability of collecting and storing data varying over the time. Other than that, since it is hard to collect data from around the world and some of the attributes in the database like number of people affected by a disaster and total damages caused by a disaster are hard to asses, thus the accuracy of such attributes may be a potential issue as well. Here is a brief introduction to the attributes of the data set copied from the source website. The attributes discussed below do not match exactly with the raw data we get but covered the majority. For simplicity, some detailed information was deleted and can be accessed at https://public.emdat.be/about. Level 1 – Disaster event Disaster Number: A unique 8 digit disaster number is generated for each disaster event. Disaster group: Two main groups of disasters are distinguished in EM-DAT: natural disasters and technological disasters. Disaster sub-group: The natural disaster category is divided into 6 sub-groups: Biological, Geophysical, Climatological, Hydrological, Meteorological and Extra-terrestrial disasters. Disaster type: 1 main disaster type is identified per event. Disaster sub-type: Subdivision related to the disaster type. Disaster sub-sub-type: Any appropriate sub-division of the disaster sub-type (not applicable for all disaster sub-types). Event name: Any specification related to the disaster which allow its identification. Glide Number: The GLobal IDEntifier number is a globally common Unique ID code for disasters. DFO/GVP/USGS: This field is used to link the EMDAT disaster with the ones of other databases: Dartmouth Flood Observatory, Global Volcanism Program, USGS. Level 2 – Country (ies) Geographical information Country: The country in which the disaster has occurred or had an impact. ISO Code: The International Organization for Standardization attributes a 3-letter code to each country. CRED uses the ISO 3166 (www.iso.org). This field is automatically linked to the country. Region: The region to which the country belongs. This field is automatically linked to the country. CRED use the UN regional division (see at unstats.un.org) Continent: The continent to which the country belongs. This field is automatically linked to the country. River basin: Name of the river basins of the affected area (used usually for flood event). Epicenter: Information on the location of the epicenter of an earthquake. E.g. 30 km SW of Naples Latitude: North-South coordinates; when available (used for earthquakes, volcanoes and floods) Longitude: East-West coordinates; when available (used for earthquakes, volcanoes and floods) Location: Geographical specification (e.g. name of a city, village, department, province, state, or district). Temporal information Start day/month/year: The date when the disaster occurred. End day/month/year: The date when the disaster ended. Local time: The local time when the disaster occurred (given for sudden disasters like earthquakes and volcanoes). Physical characteristics Origin: The triggering origin of the disaster (i.e. Heavy rains for a flood, drought for a forest fire). Associated disasters 1 and 2: The secondary and /or associated effects or consequences of a primary event (i.e. Landslide for a flood, explosion after an earthquake, etc …) Disaster magnitude scale and value: The “intensity “of a specific disaster (the unit is automatically linked to the disaster type) Status Aid contribution: The total amount (given in 000’US$ current value, i.e. value at the time of the report) of contribution for immediate relief activities given to the country as a response to the disaster. OFDA response: Whether or not OFDA responded to the disaster. Level 3 – Source of information Reporting date: Latest reporting date of the source Reliability score (1/5): A reliability score going ranking from (1) very low - to (5) very high, has been established in order to ensure the quality of the data Human impact Deaths: Number of people who lost their life because the event happened. Missing: The number of people whose whereabouts since the disaster are unknown, and presumed dead based on official figures. Total deaths: deaths + missing people Injured: People suffering from physical injuries, trauma, or an illness requiring immediate medical assistance as a direct result of a disaster. Affected: People requiring immediate assistance during an emergency situation. Homeless: Number of people whose house is destroyed or heavily damaged and therefore need shelter after an event. Total affected: The total affected is the sum of injured, affected and homeless Economic impact Total estimated damages (in 000’US$ current value): A value of all damages and economic losses directly or indirectly related to the disaster. Reconstruction cost (in 000’US$ current value): These costs are for the replacement of lost assets. Insured losses (in 000’US$ current value): Economic damages which are covered by the insurance companies. Sectorial impact Infrastructural impact: The infrastructure that was damaged or destroyed by the disaster, given in absolute values or percentages: Houses (number), Bridges (number), Commercial/business (number), Roads (km), Rails (km), Education (number of schools), Health (numbers of health centers/hospitals), Forest (ha), Farmland/crops (ha) "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation Based on information about the attributes from the last chapter and the selected questions we want to study for this project, we did an initial filtering of the attributes in the data set. First we calculate see the top ten attributes with highest missing percentage. ## columns count ## 1 Reconstruction_Costs 0.9973317 ## 2 Reconstruction_Costs_Adjusted 0.9973317 ## 3 Local_Time 0.9548115 ## 4 Associated_Dis2 0.9434498 ## 5 Aid 0.9418144 ## 6 Subsubtype 0.9240833 ## 7 Response 0.9184025 ## 8 Insured_Damages 0.9116027 Below lists the ten attributes we deleted and the main reason we deleted them. Note that we categorize according to the main concern since there may be multiple reasons for one attribute. Attributes not interested in studying: Name,Local_Time,River_Basin,Group,Location,River_Basin Attributes with very high missing percentage: Reconstruction_Costs,Reconstruction_Costs_Adjusted Attributes that has similar information contained elsewhere or those with no clear explanation documented: Adm_Level,Admin1_Code,Admin2_Code,Geo_Locations,Latitude,Longitude,Year ## [1] 11618 33 After this initial filtering, we have 33 columns left. We categorize the attributes into two main groups: basic information and impact information. Basic information includes subgroups of geographical information, physical information, temporal information, and status (appeal and aid); and impact information includes subgroups of human impact and economic impact. As we progress further, we will look into the attributes more in detail and select the most interested attributes to study. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values 4.0.1 Missing percentage of entire data set Plot the missing percentage of columns and sort them decreasingly. We see that there are 14 columns that have more than 50% missing values, 9 columns that have less than 40% missing values and 10 columns that are complete. We will look into some them and briefly discuss the patterns and potential reasons behind the scene. We will also continue cleaning the data in the process. Import function plot_patterns(df, percent = TRUE) from the .R file. Since the data set is quite large, if we examine the missing patterns using the whole set, it is hard to view the patterns in a graph, so we divided the data into subsets and study the missing patterns separately based on the categories discussed in the previous chapter. 4.0.2 Categorization missing patterns Column 2-4 describes the categorization of a natural disaster. Plot the missing patterns for these four attributes. Here, we see that every natural disaster has attribute Type and Subgroup, most have attribute Subtype and few has Subsubtype. From the righthandside bar plot, we see that more than 75% of the natural disasters has a three-layer categorization, and only around 10% has four-layer categorization marked as complete cases. 4.0.3 Impact data missing patterns Column 18-23 describes human impact and economic impact of a natural disaster which will help us study the consequences of different disasters happening in different places. Here, we see that No_Homeless and No_Injured columns have the most missing value percentage around 75%, and the remaining three columns have less than 40% missing values. Shown in the pattern plot, there are few complete cases. It is understandable that such data is hard to collect and is always subject to change over the time. Column 29-32 describes economic impact of a natural disaster which also helps us study the consequences of disasters. Here, we see that all four columns have rather high missing percentage. Shown in the pattern plot, there are few complete cases. It is understandable that such data is hard to collect and is always subject to change over the time. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results", " Chapter 5 Results 5.0.1 Time We want to firstly understand time pattern of natural disasters. We are only given data from 1990 to 2020, so that would be our time focus. The above graph provides a macro look on number of natural disasters over this period of time. Note that we are not studying disaster effects on different countries/region for this part. As it is seen on the above graph, the total number of natural disasters reaches its valley around year 1991, and reaches the peak around 2000, and the number is stable and gradually decreasing from 2000 to present days. Then we want to go a level deeper to investigate how different subgroup of natural disasters change over time. As seen in the above graph, different subgroups of disaster does not necessarily follows the macro trend analyzed above. Among all of them, hydrological, meterological and biological disasters are the top three contributors to the total numeber of disasters. Hydrological disasters can sometime account for half of the disasters recorded. The number of those subgroups of disasters slowly increase from 1990 to around 2005, and the number remains stable/ slightly decreases from 2005 to 2020. The number of the rest of the two subgroups disasters remain stable from 1990 to 2020. ## # A tibble: 2 × 3 ## # Groups: Subgroup [1] ## Subgroup Type Occurences ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 Hydrological Flood 4324 ## 2 Hydrological Landslide 545 ## # A tibble: 2 × 3 ## # Groups: Subgroup [1] ## Subgroup Type Occurences ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 Meteorological Storm 3073 ## 2 Meteorological Extreme temperature 529 Next, we want to analyze time trend for different types of disasters over the years. Flood and storm are two types of nartual diasters that occur the mostly frequently. Their occurences are much higher the others as shown on the above graph. By understanding type composition for different subgroups, we see that flood is the main contributor for hydrological disasters(around 90%), and storm is the main contributor for meteorological disasters(around 85%). 5.0.2 Region For this part of the analysis, we want to study natural disaster behaviors for different regions(continent/Country). We see from above chart that, Asia has the most number of natural disasters. America and Africa are in the 2rd and 3nd place, and their natural disaster occurrences are around half of that of Asia. Then we look at the distribution of types of disasters for different continents. Flood and storm are top 2 most frequent disasters for all continents except Africa, and flood and storm occurrences surpass the other types of disasters by a great amount for all continents except Oceania (considering the total number of disasters is relatively small). For Asia, flood occurrences exceeds storm occurrences by a relatively significant amount. For Americas and Europe, flood occurrences and storm occurrences are closer. But we see a higher number of storms than floods in America. For Africa, Epidemic is the second highest types of natural disasters. This maybe due to its relatively weak economy and extreme weather conditions. As the next step, we want to look at natural disasters level by different countries. We see that the top countries with the greatest number of natural disasters are China, USA, India, Philippines, and Indonesia, with majority of these countries residing in Asia. China, USA, and India are among the countries with the greatest areas. And Indonesia and Philippines have much smaller area size than the other 3, although their natural disaster occurrences are comparable with the other 3. Besides the top 5 countries, as we further go down the list from 5 to 10, most of them are Asian countries as we see on the graph. Then, we want to look at natural disaster composition for different countries. Storms and floods are top contributors for all countries. We see that USA has the greatest number of storms out of all countries, and it’s much larger than its other disasters. We also see that landslide is another top contributor for the top countries with the most number of disasters. The above graph shows the distribution annual disaster for different countries. We see that for the top 5 countries mentioned, the spread is much bigger, which means that there are more variation. For the rest of the countries, their annual disaster occurrence is more concentrated. 5.0.3 Country and Time For this part of analysis, we want to understand if there is any time pattern of disasters for different countries. As seen in the above graph, there seems to be no significant time pattern for any of the countries on the aggregate level of disasters. We then want to understand if there is any trend for specific type of disaster for top 5 countries. We see that for China and India, flood reaches its peak around year 2005, and then decreases to pre-2005 level. Indonesia is experiencing an increasing number of flood over time, and the number reaches the peak in year of 2020. We don’t see a significant time pattern of flood for any of the countries. 5.0.4 Flood and Storm We want to further look at two types of most frequent natural disasters: storms and floods. Firstly, we want to understand subtypes occurrences for floods. We see that Riverine flood is the most frequent subtype of flood. The fact that “NA” increases from 2015 and Riverine flood decreases from 2015 may mean that we are missing data for categorization of Riverine flood from 2015, so it may not mean that this Riverine flood decreases over time objectively. Then we want to understand what the origin of flood. And as we see on the graph, heavy rains is the biggest contributor. Then we analyze storm similarly. We see that tropical cyclone appear the most frequently. “Heavy Rains” is also the biggest origin for storm. As we see there is an overlap of origin for different types of disasters. We want to understand what are the most common origins are, and what they cause. As we see on the above graph, different types of rain are the number one origin for floods, landslides and storms. We also see that trainsopical cyclone is the top origin for drought. And for different continents, the biggest disaster origin is the same, which is “Heavy Rain”. We also see a great amount of missing information as well. 5.0.5 Total Deaths We want to study the severeness of a natural disaster by its consequences. For evaluating people affected by the disaster, we choose Total_Deaths, and Total_Affected as representations. In terms of the economic consequences, since the money value estimated for damages are over a 30-year time range where money has different values in different periods, we will directly use the column Total_Damages_Adjusted from the data source which takes into consideration of this point and adjusted the value to the same level. From chapter 04, we saw that data concerning the consequences have rather high percentage of missing values, thus we will only use those instances with these attributes for this section. We understand that the result might cause bias because of potential missing patterns. The most concerning consequence is the number of people dead in a natural disaster. Select instances where attribute Total_Deaths is not missing and take a look at the mean deaths of different subtype of disasters in three time periods 1990-2020,2020-2010,2010-2020. Note that Tsunami has mean deaths number 3138,10346 for 2010-2020 and 2000-2010, and drought has mean deaths 3360 for 2010-2020, greatly higher than other values; to avoid the x range being too large and not beign able to see the remaining values, we give x axis a limit value range. From the above plot, we could easily see a pattern that 1990-2000 period mean deaths value is larger than 2000-2010 and 2010-2020 in several subtypes of disaster including flash flood, riverine flood, coastal flood, epidemic and tropical cyclone. We infer that this might result from the improvements of human techniques in fields like water conservancy projects as well as improvements of the speed and ability to evacuate so that more lives could be saved. However in the graph, we could also see the reverse order like in subtype Tsunami, ground movement, heat wave(earthquake), one possible explanation could be that these disasters are usually hard to predict and control, and the rapid increase in population over the time might lead to more deaths on average. 5.0.6 Economic Damages Next, we look at the total damage caused by different natural disasters. To better see the general distribution of the damage, we only used 90% of the data, and we sort the data by the mean value of total damage of each subtype. In the mean time, we also split the data into three time periods to see if there is any trend over the time. From the facet plot, we see that Tsunami, severe winter condition, and ground movement are the top three disasters which caused the most economic damages. In most subtypes of disasters, we see many outliers which is easy to understand since there are always severe conditions happening with extreme weather or special cnoditions that might lead to very large damage. In subtypes like mudslide, flood, forest fire, and drought, we see a right shift trend over the three time periods. Considering the previous results, we infer that this might results from more frequently extreme weather occurring around the world that cused more severe natural disasters and consequently more damages. Of course, not all subtyles of disasters have such shift, many subtypes share a similar distribution of damages over the time. 5.0.7 Flood and Storm deaths by region From previous section, we saw two types of most frequent natural disasters are storms and floods. Here, we would like to visulize the number of deaths each disaster caused in differnet regions. We see from the first graph that flood causes a larger average number of deaths in Asia and Africa, and there are some fluctuates in these regions when total deaths is over 100, while in most America and European regions, the distribution are alike, densely distributed close to 0 and then the density decreases. Similar situation appears in the second graph. Asian regions are more fragile to storms and have larger average number of deaths for storms, but the overall distribution is still pretty identical except for that of Southern Asia where we see three peaks in the ridgeline plot.

"],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion This project aims to explore time/region trend of natural disasters, and its related influences. One of the limitations of our projects is that we study different disasters independently. In reality, there maybe interactions of hazards that may cause further impacts have further implications. For this project, we were not able to cover this topic in details. Also, when studying the damages caused by disasters, the data is very incomplete, containing high proportion of missing values. The results drawn from the non-missing data might be biased, and we fail to link the damages more closely with the previous study of the occurrence pattern which is also something that we could continue study for this project. Another aspect we could further study as mentioned above is the potential correlations between attributes. One of the lessons we learned from doing this project is that the amount of data, and potential aspects we could explore in the data can be overwhelmingly vast, and it’s crucial to structure the analyses, organize schedule and balance efforts on priorities.
