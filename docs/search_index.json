In this project, we propose the following questions aiming to provide some insights for preparation and assessment of natural disasters: 1. What are the patterns of occurrence for the most frequently happening disasters by region? 2. Over time, how do the patterns change and how do they help people prepare for future disasters? 3. How to define the level of damage for a disaster and could we give an assessment of the vulnerability of different regions against disasters? "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources The data set we chose is from EM-DAT (The International Disaster Database) at https://public.emdat.be/data. EM-DAT (Emergency Event Database) was created with the initial support of the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Belgian Government. It contains essential core data on the occurrence and effects of over 22,000 mass disasters in the world from 1900 to the present day. The database is compiled from various sources, including UN agencies, non-governmental organisations, insurance companies, research institutes and press agencies.To narrow down the range of the data for the use of this project, we selected natural disaster data from all five continents, dating between 1990 to 2020. Query the natural disaster data from source and select natural disaster in all locations provided between time range 1990 to 2020 which generates a single excel file. When reading the excel file, we skip the first 6 title lines and assign the column names accordingly. The raw data has 50 attributes and 11618 rows in total. ## [1] 11618 50 Possible issues with the data: We know that the database is compiled from various sources from organizations and agencies, so there might be concerns about the consistency of information. Also, since the we are looking at data over a 30-year range, so there might also be concerns about the ability of collecting and storing data varying over the time. Other than that, since it is hard to collect data from around the world and some of the attributes in the database like number of people affected by a disaster and total damages caused by a disaster are hard to asses, thus the accuracy of such attributes may be a potential issue as well. Here is a brief introduction to the attributes of the data set copied from the source website. The attributes discussed below do not match exactly with the raw data we get but covered the majority. For simplicity, some detailed information was deleted and can be accessed at https://public.emdat.be/about. Level 1 – Disaster event Disaster Number: A unique 8 digit disaster number is generated for each disaster event. Disaster group: Two main groups of disasters are distinguished in EM-DAT: natural disasters and technological disasters. Disaster sub-group: The natural disaster category is divided into 6 sub-groups: Biological, Geophysical, Climatological, Hydrological, Meteorological and Extra-terrestrial disasters. Disaster type: 1 main disaster type is identified per event. Disaster sub-type: Subdivision related to the disaster type. Disaster sub-sub-type: Any appropriate sub-division of the disaster sub-type (not applicable for all disaster sub-types). Event name: Any specification related to the disaster which allow its identification. Glide Number: The GLobal IDEntifier number is a globally common Unique ID code for disasters. DFO/GVP/USGS: This field is used to link the EMDAT disaster with the ones of other databases: Dartmouth Flood Observatory, Global Volcanism Program, USGS. Level 2 – Country (ies) Geographical information Country: The country in which the disaster has occurred or had an impact. ISO Code: The International Organization for Standardization attributes a 3-letter code to each country. CRED uses the ISO 3166 (www.iso.org). This field is automatically linked to the country. Region: The region to which the country belongs. This field is automatically linked to the country. CRED use the UN regional division (see at unstats.un.org) Continent: The continent to which the country belongs. This field is automatically linked to the country. River basin: Name of the river basins of the affected area (used usually for flood event). Epicenter: Information on the location of the epicenter of an earthquake. E.g. 30 km SW of Naples Latitude: North-South coordinates; when available (used for earthquakes, volcanoes and floods) Longitude: East-West coordinates; when available (used for earthquakes, volcanoes and floods) Location: Geographical specification (e.g. name of a city, village, department, province, state, or district). Temporal information Start day/month/year: The date when the disaster occurred. End day/month/year: The date when the disaster ended. Local time: The local time when the disaster occurred (given for sudden disasters like earthquakes and volcanoes). Physical characteristics Origin: The triggering origin of the disaster (i.e. Heavy rains for a flood, drought for a forest fire). Associated disasters 1 and 2: The secondary and /or associated effects or consequences of a primary event (i.e. Landslide for a flood, explosion after an earthquake, etc …) Disaster magnitude scale and value: The “intensity “of a specific disaster (the unit is automatically linked to the disaster type) Status Aid contribution: The total amount (given in 000’US$ current value, i.e. value at the time of the report) of contribution for immediate relief activities given to the country as a response to the disaster. OFDA response: Whether or not OFDA responded to the disaster. Level 3 – Source of information Reporting date: Latest reporting date of the source Reliability score (1/5): A reliability score going ranking from (1) very low - to (5) very high, has been established in order to ensure the quality of the data Human impact Deaths: Number of people who lost their life because the event happened. Missing: The number of people whose whereabouts since the disaster are unknown, and presumed dead based on official figures. Total deaths: deaths + missing people Injured: People suffering from physical injuries, trauma, or an illness requiring immediate medical assistance as a direct result of a disaster. Affected: People requiring immediate assistance during an emergency situation. Homeless: Number of people whose house is destroyed or heavily damaged and therefore need shelter after an event. Total affected: The total affected is the sum of injured, affected and homeless Economic impact Total estimated damages (in 000’US$ current value): A value of all damages and economic losses directly or indirectly related to the disaster. Reconstruction cost (in 000’US$ current value): These costs are for the replacement of lost assets. Insured losses (in 000’US$ current value): Economic damages which are covered by the insurance companies. Sectorial impact Infrastructural impact: The infrastructure that was damaged or destroyed by the disaster, given in absolute values or percentages: Houses (number), Bridges (number), Commercial/business (number), Roads (km), Rails (km), Education (number of schools), Health (numbers of health centers/hospitals), Forest (ha), Farmland/crops (ha) "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation Based on information about the attributes from the last chapter and the selected questions we want to study for this project, we did an initial filtering of the attributes in the data set. First we calculate see the top ten attributes with highest missing percentage. ## columns count ## 1 Reconstruction_Costs 0.9973317 ## 2 Reconstruction_Costs_Adjusted 0.9973317 ## 3 Local_Time 0.9548115 ## 4 Associated_Dis2 0.9434498 ## 5 Aid 0.9418144 ## 6 Subsubtype 0.9240833 ## 7 Response 0.9184025 ## 8 Insured_Damages 0.9116027 Below lists the ten attributes we deleted and the main reason we deleted them. Note that we categorize according to the main concern since there may be multiple reasons for one attribute. Attributes not interested in studying: Name,Local_Time,River_Basin,Group,Location,River_Basin Attributes with very high missing percentage: Reconstruction_Costs,Reconstruction_Costs_Adjusted Attributes that has similar information contained elsewhere or those with no clear explanation documented: Adm_Level,Admin1_Code,Admin2_Code,Geo_Locations,Latitude,Longitude,Year ## [1] 11618 33 After this initial filtering, we have 33 columns left. We categorize the attributes into two main groups: basic information and impact information. Basic information includes subgroups of geographical information, physical information, temporal information, and status (appeal and aid); and impact information includes subgroups of human impact and economic impact. As we progress further, we will look into the attributes more in detail and select the most interested attributes to study. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values 4.0.1 Missing percentage of entire data set Plot the missing percentage of columns and sort them decreasingly. We see that there are 14 columns that have more than 50% missing values, 9 columns that have less than 40% missing values and 10 columns that are complete. We will look into some them and briefly discuss the patterns and potential reasons behind the scene. We will also continue cleaning the data in the process. Import function plot_patterns(df, percent = TRUE) from the .R file. Since the data set is quite large, if we examine the missing patterns using the whole set, it is hard to view the patterns in a graph, so we divided the data into subsets and study the missing patterns separately based on the categories discussed in the previous chapter. 4.0.2 Categorization missing patterns Column 2-4 describes the categorization of a natural disaster. Plot the missing patterns for these four attributes. Here, we see that every natural disaster has attribute Type and Subgroup, most have attribute Subtype and few has Subsubtype. From the righthandside bar plot, we see that more than 75% of the natural disasters has a three-layer categorization, and only around 10% has four-layer categorization marked as complete cases. 4.0.3 Impact data missing patterns Column 18-23 describes human impact and economic impact of a natural disaster which will help us study the consequences of different disasters happening in different places. Here, we see that No_Homeless and No_Injured columns have the most missing value percentage around 75%, and the remaining three columns have less than 40% missing values. Shown in the pattern plot, there are few complete cases. It is understandable that such data is hard to collect and is always subject to change over the time. Column 29-32 describes economic impact of a natural disaster which also helps us study the consequences of disasters. Here, we see that all four columns have rather high missing percentage. Shown in the pattern plot, there are few complete cases. It is understandable that such data is hard to collect and is always subject to change over the time.
