In this project, we propose the following questions aiming to provide some insights for preparation and assessment of natural disasters: 1. What are the patterns of occurrence for the most frequently happening disasters by region? 2. Over time, how do the patterns change and how do they help people prepare for future disasters? 3. How to define the level of damage for a disaster and could we give an assessment of the vulnerability of different regions against disasters? "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources The data set we chose is from EM-DAT (The International Disaster Database) at https://public.emdat.be/data. EM-DAT (Emergency Event Database) was created with the initial support of the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Belgian Government. It contains essential core data on the occurrence and effects of over 22,000 mass disasters in the world from 1900 to the present day. The database is compiled from various sources, including UN agencies, non-governmental organisations, insurance companies, research institutes and press agencies.To narrow down the range of the data for the use of this project, we selected natural disaster data from all five continents, dating between 1990 to 2020. Query the natural disaster data from source and select natural disaster in all locations provided between time range 1990 to 2020 which generates a single excel file. When reading the excel file, we skip the first 6 title lines and assign the column names accordingly. The raw data has 50 attributes and 11618 rows in total. ## [1] 11618 50 Here is a brief introduction to the attributes of the data set copied from the source website. The attributes discussed below do not match exactly with the raw data we get but covered the majority. For simplicity, some detailed information was deleted and can be accessed at https://public.emdat.be/about. Level 1 – Disaster event Disaster Number: A unique 8 digit disaster number is generated for each disaster event. Disaster group: Two main groups of disasters are distinguished in EM-DAT: natural disasters and technological disasters. Disaster sub-group: The natural disaster category is divided into 6 sub-groups: Biological, Geophysical, Climatological, Hydrological, Meteorological and Extra-terrestrial disasters. Disaster type: 1 main disaster type is identified per event. Disaster sub-type: Subdivision related to the disaster type. Disaster sub-sub-type: Any appropriate sub-division of the disaster sub-type (not applicable for all disaster sub-types). Event name: Any specification related to the disaster which allow its identification. Glide Number: The GLobal IDEntifier number is a globally common Unique ID code for disasters. DFO/GVP/USGS: This field is used to link the EMDAT disaster with the ones of other databases: Dartmouth Flood Observatory, Global Volcanism Program, USGS. Level 2 – Country (ies) Geographical information Country: The country in which the disaster has occurred or had an impact. ISO Code: The International Organization for Standardization attributes a 3-letter code to each country. CRED uses the ISO 3166 (www.iso.org). This field is automatically linked to the country. Region: The region to which the country belongs. This field is automatically linked to the country. CRED use the UN regional division (see at unstats.un.org) Continent: The continent to which the country belongs. This field is automatically linked to the country. River basin: Name of the river basins of the affected area (used usually for flood event). Epicenter: Information on the location of the epicenter of an earthquake. E.g. 30 km SW of Naples Latitude: North-South coordinates; when available (used for earthquakes, volcanoes and floods) Longitude: East-West coordinates; when available (used for earthquakes, volcanoes and floods) Location: Geographical specification (e.g. name of a city, village, department, province, state, or district). Temporal information Start day/month/year: The date when the disaster occurred. End day/month/year: The date when the disaster ended. Local time: The local time when the disaster occurred (given for sudden disasters like earthquakes and volcanoes). Physical characteristics Origin: The triggering origin of the disaster (i.e. Heavy rains for a flood, drought for a forest fire). Associated disasters 1 and 2: The secondary and /or associated effects or consequences of a primary event (i.e. Landslide for a flood, explosion after an earthquake, etc …) Disaster magnitude scale and value: The “intensity “of a specific disaster (the unit is automatically linked to the disaster type) Status Aid contribution: The total amount (given in 000’US$ current value, i.e. value at the time of the report) of contribution for immediate relief activities given to the country as a response to the disaster. OFDA response: Whether or not OFDA responded to the disaster. Level 3 – Source of information Reporting date: Latest reporting date of the source Reliability score (1/5): A reliability score going ranking from (1) very low - to (5) very high, has been established in order to ensure the quality of the data Human impact Deaths: Number of people who lost their life because the event happened. Missing: The number of people whose whereabouts since the disaster are unknown, and presumed dead based on official figures. Total deaths: deaths + missing people Injured: People suffering from physical injuries, trauma, or an illness requiring immediate medical assistance as a direct result of a disaster. Affected: People requiring immediate assistance during an emergency situation. Homeless: Number of people whose house is destroyed or heavily damaged and therefore need shelter after an event. Total affected: The total affected is the sum of injured, affected and homeless Economic impact Total estimated damages (in 000’US$ current value): A value of all damages and economic losses directly or indirectly related to the disaster. Reconstruction cost (in 000’US$ current value): These costs are for the replacement of lost assets. Insured losses (in 000’US$ current value): Economic damages which are covered by the insurance companies. Sectorial impact Infrastructural impact: The infrastructure that was damaged or destroyed by the disaster, given in absolute values or percentages: Houses (number), Bridges (number), Commercial/business (number), Roads (km), Rails (km), Education (number of schools), Health (numbers of health centers/hospitals), Forest (ha), Farmland/crops (ha) "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation Based on information about the attributes from the last chapter and the selected questions we want to study for this project, we did an initial filtering of the attributes in the data set. First we calculate see the top ten attributes with highest missing percentage. ## columns count ## 1 Reconstruction_Costs 0.9973317 ## 2 Reconstruction_Costs_Adjusted 0.9973317 ## 3 Local_Time 0.9548115 ## 4 Associated_Dis2 0.9434498 ## 5 Aid 0.9418144 ## 6 Subsubtype 0.9240833 ## 7 Response 0.9184025 ## 8 Insured_Damages 0.9116027 Below lists the ten attributes we deleted and the main reason we deleted them. Note that we categorize according to the main concern since there may be multiple reasons for one attribute. Attributes not interested in studying: Name,Local_Time,River_Basin,Group,Location,River_Basin Attributes with very high missing percentage: Reconstruction_Costs,Reconstruction_Costs_Adjusted Attributes that has similar information contained elsewhere or those with no clear explanation documented: Adm_Level,Admin1_Code,Admin2_Code,Geo_Locations,Latitude,Longitude,Year ## [1] 11618 33 After this initial filtering, we have 33 columns left. We categorize the attributes into two main groups: basic information and impact information. Basic information includes subgroups of geographical information, physical information, temporal information, and status (appeal and aid); and impact information includes subgroups of human impact and economic impact. As we progress further, we will look into the attributes more in detail and select the most interested attributes to study. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values ####First draft 1018 We want to firstly understand holistically what are the distribution of missing values across these columns. ## Associated_Dis2 Aid Subsubtype Insured_Damages Insured_Damages_Adjusted ## 0.943449819 0.941814426 0.924083319 0.911602685 0.911602685 ## No_Homeless Appeal Declaration Associated_Dis No_Injured ## 0.843690825 0.812446204 0.756240317 0.744362197 0.743157170 ## Origin Admin2_Code Total_Damages Total_Damages_Adjusted DM_Value ## 0.689533483 0.665777242 0.663797556 0.663797556 0.650714409 ## Admin1_Code No_Affected Geo_Locations Total_Deaths Total_Affected ## 0.612756068 0.377517645 0.336374591 0.289808917 0.219228783 ## Start_Day End_Day Subtype DM_Scale End_Month ## 0.167756929 0.161645722 0.150370115 0.066362541 0.025047340 ## Start_Month No Subgroup Type Country ## 0.008865553 0.000000000 0.000000000 0.000000000 0.000000000 ## ISO Region Continent Start_Year End_Year ## 0.000000000 0.000000000 0.000000000 0.000000000 0.000000000 ## CPI ## 0.000000000 ## [1] 0.3967168 We can see that Associated_Dis2, Aid, Subsubtype, Insured_Damages and Insured_Damages_Adjusted have very high percentage of missing values (&gt;90%). Most columns have missing values, with average of 40% among all selected columns. 11 columns have nearly 0% of missing values. Since our data have large size and different type of columns, to analyze the missing value more correctly, we divide the data by their types. In our data, column2-5 are about group and type of the disaster. Column 6-9 are region of the disaster such as country, location. Column 10-12 are origin and asso. Column 13-15 are appeal, dec and aid. Column16-17 are scale and value. Column 18-23 is time. Column24-28 are human impact and economic impact.Then we make different plots of missing values. This is the plot of missing value of column6-9, about region of the disaster. from the plot, we are able to see that there are no missing values in all of those columns which are Country, ISO, Region and Continent. These are basic information of a disaster. This is the plot of missing value of column2-5, about type of the disaster. from the plot, we are able to see the subsubtype (Severe storm, Tornado, Lightning, etc.) has very high missing value, and subtype(Drought, Ground movement, Cold wave, etc.) have much smaller missing values than subsubtype. Subgroup(include Climatological, Geophysical, Meteorological) and type(Flood, storm, etc) have no missing values based on column. We further want to understand if there is a missing pattern by country (one of the basic information) for these three columns. There is no obvious pattern for “Subsubtype”. Data for all countries all present high missing value percentage pattern. But Subtype missing value percentage is quite different across countries, with Micronesia and Polynesia lowest percentage of missing values. This is the plot of missing value of column10-12, about origin and two assos of the disaster. from the plot, we are able to see that three of them has all have very high percentage of missing values. Most of the rows don’t have information on all three of these columns. This showcases that these set of columns may not be able to provide enough information for analysis. We further want to understand if there is a missing pattern by country (one of the basic information) for these three columns. These graphs show that all regions have similar patterns for missing values for this group of columns. This is the plot of missing value of column13-15, about apeal, declaration and aid of the disaster. from the plot, three of them have evenly amount of missing values, and they are quite high. But we can still see that the aid has the most missing values. Also, the row with all three of them missing have largest amount. We further want to understand if there is a missing pattern by country (one of the basic information) for these three columns. These graphs show that Appeal and Aid have similar missing pattern for regions. For Declaration, Russian Fed has higher than average missing values. This is the plot of missing value of column 16-17, about scale and value of the disaster. from the plot, the value has more missing than the scale. From the right hand side plot about pattern, we can also see that the row with value missing and scale not missing has the greatest amount. Also, the pattern of rows with both value and scale not missing has the second large amount, which is a good result for analyzing. This is the plot of missing value of column18-23, about times of the disaster. The plot shows that there are no missing valus according to start year nad end year. The two largest missing columns are start say and end day, which is reasonalbe since the the day is harder to record than month and year. From the pattern plot, the parrtern of rows with both start day and end day missing has the largest amount. This is the plot of missing value of column24-28, about human impact and economic impact of the disaster. from the plot, all of the columns of impact has missing values, but the total_affacted column has the smallest amount. The column with greatest missing values is No_Homeless, and No_Injured has lesser but similar amount of missing values. We further want to understand if there is a missing pattern by country (one of the basic information) for these three columns. No_homeless and No_injured missing percentage is similar. Whereas for No_affected, it is quite different for different regions. Western Europe and Northern Europe have highest amount of missing values.
