# Introduction 

Given that many unprecedented natural disasters like violent flood and storm happening more frequently than ever and causing a lot of losses, injuries, and even deaths in recent years, we are interested in studying the possible patterns of the occurrence and consequences of these natural disasters on a worldwide scale. In this project, we propose the following questions aiming to provide some insights for preparation and assessment of natural disasters:

*1. What are the patterns of occurrence for the most frequently happening disasters by region?*

*2. Over time, how do the patterns change and how do they help people prepare for future disasters?*

*3. Study the damage of a disaster and how does the damage a disaster of different types brought to a region differ over time?*
